## üß™ End-to-End Test Workflow

### Test Scenario: Complete Invoice-to-Payment Flow

#### 1. Create Customer (Counterparty)

**Action**: In customer dropdown, the system will use existing counterparties or allow creating new ones

**Expected Result**:
- Customer saved to `finance.counterparties` table
- `type = 'customer'`
- Available in invoice form dropdown

#### 2. Create Invoice
**Page**: Finance ‚Üí Invoices
**Action**: 
1. Click "+ Create Invoice"
2. Select customer
3. Set invoice date and due date
4. Add line items (description, quantity, unit price, tax rate)
5. Submit

**Expected Result**:
- Invoice saved to `finance.invoices` table with auto-generated number `INV-{timestamp}`
- Line items saved to `finance.invoice_items`
- Invoice shows in table with status "draft" or "sent"

- **Total Debits = Total Credits** (double-entry enforced)

#### 9. Check Balance Sheet
**Page**: Finance ‚Üí Reports ‚Üí Select "Balance Sheet"
**Action**: View as of today's date

**Expected Result**:
- Assets section shows cash accounts + AR
- Liabilities section shows AP
- Equity section shows retained earnings/capital
- **Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Equity**

#### 10. Verify Data Persistence
**Tool**: Adminer (http://localhost:8080)
**Action**: 
1. Login: db/procurex/procurex/procurex
2. Navigate to finance schema tables
3. Query data directly

**SQL Queries**:
```sql
-- Check invoices
SELECT * FROM finance.invoices ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check payments
SELECT * FROM finance.payments ORDER BY payment_date DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check transactions (double-entry)
SELECT t.*, tl.* 
FROM finance.transactions t
JOIN finance.transaction_lines tl ON t.id = tl.transaction_id
ORDER BY t.transaction_date DESC;

-- Verify balance
SELECT SUM(debit) as total_debit, SUM(credit) as total_credit
FROM finance.transaction_lines;
```

**Expected Result**:
- All data persisted correctly
- Transaction lines balanced (SUM(debits) = SUM(credits))
- Foreign key relationships intact

   ```powershell
   # Check KPIs
   (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:4001/api/finance/reports/kpis).Content
   
   # Expected: {"cash_on_hand":62000,...}
   ```

## üìù Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Export functionality**: Reports don't export to Excel/PDF yet (future enhancement)
2. **Bank statement upload**: Reconciliation UI exists but CSV upload not implemented
3. **Auto-matching**: Reconciliation requires manual checkbox marking
4. **Recurring invoices**: Not implemented (future feature)

### Backend API Notes
- Trial Balance returns string values for debit/credit (needs parseFloat)
- P&L and Balance Sheet endpoints exist but may return empty data until transactions recorded
- Double-entry trigger is active - all transactions must balance
